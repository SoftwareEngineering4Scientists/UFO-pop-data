# :alien::space_invader:ðŸ‘½ UFO sightings! ðŸ‘½:space_invader::alien:

The National UFO Reporting Center Online Database has been tracking reported UFO sightings dating back to the 1800's and earlier. We will be using this data to complete a number of our homework assignments and uncovering whether or not these sightings seem credible.

The data contained in this repo consists of two files:
* `ufo_sightings.csv`: the complete UFO sightings database, in CSV format 
(source: [NUFORC](http://www.nuforc.org/index.html))
* `apportionments.csv`: Population and density information from all US states dating back to 1900 (source: [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/density-data-text.html))
